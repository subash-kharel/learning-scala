//Scala - Lists
//Unlike arrays lists are immutable i.e. cannot change the value in the list once initialized.

//Cons is short for construct and comes from Lisp which has weird names for things; things like car and cdr.
//It means construct a new list.
//
//A cons A (or A :: B) means create a new list with A before B, where B can be a list item or a list itself and A is a list item.
